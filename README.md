# Disseration's code

This repo includes code used to create some of the plots present in my Master's dissertation. This is still under development and was build upon the repository from the non-linearity project. 


* Simulation of a nanoparticle under the influence a non-linear force with and without a delay, and also the effects of adding a Butterworth filter to our setup.
* Methods to analyse the traces gathered during the execution of our experiment.
* Vivado project used to program the FPGA in the Red Pitaya board


## Installation

Well, now, how can you run this code? Follow the next steps.

1. First clone this repo in your computer. This can be done
    * Via SSH:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/QuantumAdventures/non-linearity-experiment.git
    ```

    * Via HTTPS:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:QuantumAdventures/optical-bottle-beam.git
    ```

    * Or, by downloading the .zip of the repo and unziping in your computer.

2. Install the requirements, this will set the libraries needed with the correct version in your computer. Inside the main folder of the project run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the data! A `data` folder is needed, to get all the data used and produced in the experiment you can

    * Follow the link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OXutfn_C_7TzHMjxG4hueFKlQWNWipJT), and download it.

    * The recommendation is to download only a fraction of the data


In the end you should have the following directory structure:

## Usage

With the data downloaded, all the notebooks can be executed. To execute the scripts, run the following command inside the `optical-bottle-beam` folder:

```bash
python scripts/calculate_psd_of_experiments.py
```

Or 

```bash
python scripts/calculate_psd_of_simulations.py
```
